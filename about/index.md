## Hello, friend!

Hi, my name is [Michael Crump](http://twitter.com/mbcrump) and I work at Microsoft on the Azure platform. I'm the author of this blog and a former Developer Advocate at Telerik and 5x Microsoft MVP. My passion is helping developers be the best that they can be. I do this by [speaking](https://michaelcrump.net/media/) at conferences, [authoring](https://michaelcrump.net/media/) content, [appearing](https://michaelcrump.net/media/) on podcast and being actively involved in the developer community. If you'd like to reach out, then please begin by sending me a [tweet](http://twitter.com/mbcrump) and if that doesn't work then try email [my first name @ this domain.net].
