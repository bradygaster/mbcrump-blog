<p>I have a new cover story article published in print and online in Visual Studio Magazine today called “<a href="http://visualstudiomagazine.com/articles/2012/09/01/windows-8-apps-with-hmtl-5.aspx" target="_blank">Windows 8 Apps With HTML5</a>”. If you're an experienced Web developer you'll love the new Windows Store options to use HTML5/JavaScript/CSS3 to build an application that works in the Windows 8 UI. Here's a step-by-step guide to getting started. </p>  <p>See below for more information and a link to the online article in case you don’t get a print copy.</p>  <h3>Article Introduction</h3>  <p>We now know that Windows 8 is coming on Oct. 26. That presents developers with a decision to make for building new Metro-style applications: HTML5 with JavaScript and CSS3 or XAML with C# or Visual Basic with C++?</p>  <p>Many Web developers will choose HTML5/JavaScript/CSS3 because they already have experience with it. Once that decision's made the next step is to understand Windows Runtime (WinRT) and how its new APIs interact with Windows 8. <i>[As this issue went to press Microsoft was considering changing the name &quot;Metro&quot; to something else but hadn't yet decided on the new name. We're leaving it as &quot;Metro&quot; until a new name is officially chosen. -- Ed.]</i></p>  <p>This article takes you through the process of building your first HTML5/JavaScript/CSS3 Metro application. Let's get started.</p>  <h3>The Full Article</h3>  <p>The full article is hosted on Visual Studio Magazine and you can access it by clicking <a href="http://visualstudiomagazine.com/articles/2012/09/01/windows-8-apps-with-hmtl-5.aspx">here</a>.
