<h4>Introduction</h4>  <p>Over the weekend I was learning how to use Camtasia 2 for Mac and decided Iâ€™d produce and share a quick video. The video shows you how to get started using Xamarin.iOS. It is a very simple app but shows Labels Text Fields and Buttons and how to wire them up to work together to produce a working app. After I learn more about Camtasia 2 I will can create additional videos.</p>  <h4>The Video</h4> <iframe height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/Xbgj9D5Em1o?rel=0" frameborder="0" width="480" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>  <h4>Wrap-up</h4>  <p>Thanks for watching and let me know what types of videos that you would like to see in the future. </p>
