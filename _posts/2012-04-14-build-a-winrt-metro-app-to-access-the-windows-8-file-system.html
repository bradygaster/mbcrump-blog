<p>I have a new article published on DevProConnections today called “<a href="http://www.devproconnections.com/article/windows8/winrt-metro-windows-8-142173" target="_blank">Build a WinRT Metro App to Access the Windows 8 File System</a>”. This article takes a look at what is involved with accessing the Windows 8 file system to create read modify and delete files. We also discuss file attributes and the “Most Recently Used” list in Windows 8. </p>  <h3>Article Introduction</h3>  <p>Windows 8 introduces a new native runtime called Windows Runtime (WinRT) which is the backbone of the new Metro user experience in Windows 8. For Windows developers now is the ideal time to explore the Windows 8 Developer Preview and start working with Windows 8 and WinRT. Because file system access is one of the first things any developer needs to understand when learning a new platform a good way to help you get your feet wet with WinRT is to use it to build a file system–access application. I'll walk you through the process of creating a Windows 8 C# and XAML Metro application and demonstrate how to manipulate files programmatically. After building the app we'll explore additional file features including reading file properties and adding a file to the Windows most recently used (MRU) list.</p>  <h3>The Full Article</h3>  <p>The full article is hosted on DevProConnections and you can access it by clicking <a href="http://www.devproconnections.com/article/windows8/winrt-metro-windows-8-142173">here</a>.
