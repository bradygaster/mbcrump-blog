Let me get this out of the way first, this post isn't about losing weight or building muscle.  It's about how you can change your lifestyle once and for all and live a healthy life. I am not a doctor or nutritionist, but I have been on both sides of the fence. I used to have a physical job when I was younger, then I entered my professional career and sat at a computer desk all day. Needless to say, my weight got out of control when I became sedentary and came home to sit on the couch. This post covers the changes that I've made to live a healthier lifestyle. 

Here is the short version of what I focused on. 

1. The food you put into your body matters the most. 
2. Exercise or getting up and just moving is vital to your success. 
3. You must achieve a proper work/life balance. 
4. There is **NO** supplement to help you get fit. Just hard work. 

The longer version... 

1. I removed all soda/artificial sweeteners and flavoring from my diet.
	* 	This was very hard for me, but I haven't had a soda since August and only drink water, coffee and milk.
	*   Look at the ingredients on everything you buy. If it has more 10-15 ingredients, and words you can't even pronounce, then you probably don't want to put it in your body. 
	*   Eat vegetables, fruit, whole grains and I'm a big fan of high protein meats. 
	*   Limit the amount of junk food. To say that you will never have a candy bar again is just plain stupid. Just have one once a month, instead of every couple of days.

2. I exercise for at least 30 minutes a day 5 times a week. 
	* I use a treadmill and a [SurfShelf](http://www.amazon.com/SurfShelf-Treadmill-Desk-Laptop-Holder/dp/B001M04RBK/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1416100921&sr=8-1&keywords=surfshelf) that I've had for years. I walk or run at least 2 miles, sometimes more but **never** less. 
	* I started logging my exercise and it really helped me look back at what I've done. (I'm not going to recommend an app, etc. Just find something that works for you and do that.) It could be a simple text file in a dropbox folder. Just keep it up to date. You don't need a fitbit, app, scale, etc. to measure progress. Your clothing will let you know.
	* I recommend getting into some kind of strength training. You can pick up a pair of dumbbells for $30 at many local retailers. Start small and work yourself up. 
	* I do push-ups daily. When I first started, I couldn't even do 1 good push-up. There are all kinds of exercises that you can do without spending a dime. You may not have huge biceps, but that really isn't the goal. 
3. Family first, Job second. 
	* Sit time aside every single day to spend with your spouse. Give them the attention they deserve. 
	* If you sit in a room with your family with the laptop open, then you **aren't there**. You are in another world. Read this point a couple of times and let it sink in. 
	* Your spouse / kids will be there, when your job isn't. You aren't defined by your job, if you think work is all that matters then it is time for a reality check. 

4. When it comes to supplements, I only buy three things. (FYI: None of these links are referral links and no one paid me a dime to suggest them.)  
	* [Rainbow Light Multivitamins for Men](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007YCC7S/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) - I found these are great and an affordable multivitamin for men. They make the same vitamin for women. 
	* [Whey for Post-workout](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013OVWHM/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) or [Casein for nighttime](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008NZETGU/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) protein powder. Notice both of these protein powders have no artificial flavors or sweeteners. 
	* I can't recommend a protein bar except one that you have made yourself. 
	
I believe with just a few changes you can achieve a healthier lifestyle that will last for a lifetime instead of lasting for just a few months. Overall, the choice is yours. Nothing in this blog post is new information. It is just what one guy did that made a major impact in my well-being. I hope this helps!
