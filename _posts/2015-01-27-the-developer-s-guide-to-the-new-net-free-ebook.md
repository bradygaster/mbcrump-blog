Hey everyone,
<br><br>
I just wanted to write a quick blog post on a new eBook that [Sam Basu](http://twitter.com/samidip) and I created. The title of the eBook is “The Developer’s Guide to the New .NET”. It is a breakdown on everything new that is happening with .NET in 2015\.
<br><br>
For more info on the eBook go to this page: [http://developer.telerik.com/announcements/developers-guide-new-net/](http://developer.telerik.com/announcements/developers-guide-new-net/ "http://developer.telerik.com/announcements/developers-guide-new-net/")
<br><br>
Thanks,
<br><br>
Michael
