<h4>Introduction</h4>  <p>I was recently interviewed by Adam Stephensen for his show on <a href="http://tv.ssw.com/">SSW TV</a>. We talked for about 30 minutes on my experience with Windows Phone 8. We also discussed several other topics including a funny story about Twitter sending me a cease and desist letter for an app I wrote. We had a great time recording it and I hope you enjoy it as well. </p>  <h4>Podcast Info</h4>  <p>You can watch the interview by visiting this <a href="http://tv.ssw.com/4918/windows-phone-8-development-with-mvp-michael-crump">page</a> and be sure to check the other episodes.</p>  <p>Thanks for watching and I hope you found something useful from it.</p>
