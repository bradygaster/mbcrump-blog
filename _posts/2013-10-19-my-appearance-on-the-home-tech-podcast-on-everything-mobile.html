<h4>Introduction</h4>  <p>I was recently interviewed by <a href="http://twitter.com/jcollison">Jim Collison</a> for his podcast called the <a href="http://theaverageguy.tv/">Home Tech Podcast</a>. We talked for about 80 minutes on everything from Windows 8.1 to FireFox OS Windows Phone 8 and other technology. It was an absolutely blast and in the post show we upgraded his phone live and talked about the Windows Phone 8 GDR3 release. </p>  <h4>Podcast Info</h4>  <p>You can watch my interview by visiting this <a href="http://theaverageguy.tv/2013/10/19/michael-crump-mbcrump-microsoft-mvp-from-telerik-windows-8-1-firefox-os-phone-and-easy-windows-phone-8-development-lumia-520-to-gdr3-ht139/">page</a>.</p>  <p>Catch more from Jim at <a href="http://coaching.gallup.com/">http://coaching.gallup.com</a> or <a href="http://theAverageGuy.tv">http://theAverageGuy.tv</a>.</p>  <p>Thanks for watching and I hope you found something useful from it.</p>
