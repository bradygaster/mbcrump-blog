The conversation starts out with a short recap on some of the recent craziness around Nokia and Microsoft and the calibre of phones and tablets coming out these days - it's time for the second wave of Win 8 devices! Michael digs into the benefits and challenges around switching to Windows Phone 8 including access to new resources dealing with multiple screen resolutions and buildings apps where the code base can be largely shared between Windows Phone 8 and Windows 8. It's time to make the move!</p>  <p>Link to the <a href="http://www.thetabletshow.com/default.aspx?showNum=104">episode</a></p>  <p>Link to the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/dn385709.aspx">MSDN article</a></p>
