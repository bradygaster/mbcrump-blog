<p>I have a new in-depth article published online today called “<a href="http://developer.telerik.com/featured/windows-10-whats-developers/">Windows 10 – What’s in it For Developers?</a>”.</p>  <p>See below for more information and a link to the online article.</p>  <h4>Article Introduction</h4>  <p>Windows 10 was unveiled on September 30 2014 as a <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/preview-iso">technical preview</a> for individuals that signed up to become a Windows Insider. Since the release we’ve seen a lot of coverage from media outlets regarding new features that end-users will be excited about but very little coverage for developers. In this post I’m going to point out several things that caught my eye as a developer that works daily with the Microsoft stack.</p>  <ul></ul>  <h4>The Full Article</h4>  <p>The full article is hosted on the TDN website and you can access it by clicking <a href="http://developer.telerik.com/featured/windows-10-whats-developers/">here</a>. Don’t forget to rate it and leave comments if you have any problems.</p>
