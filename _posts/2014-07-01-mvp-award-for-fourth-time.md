I am thankful to Microsoft for renewing my MVP in the Windows Platform Development expertise. You may be asking yourself "What is the Windows Platform Development expertise?" Basically the Client Development and Windows Phone Development expertise merged into Windows Platform Development. So this means that I get to talk about everything that I'm already passionate about and it fits nicely in this new category!     I'd like to thank my family my employer (Telerik) and my MVP Lead (Dora Chan) who all believed in me and helped me pursue my dreams.     I look forward to doing even more in the upcoming future!
