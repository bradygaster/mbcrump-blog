## Next Stop: Microsoft

Over the past four years, I've had the opportunity to work at an innovative company with some of the coolest, [smartest people](http://developer.telerik.com/community/#who-we-are) around. [Telerik](http://www.telerik.com) gave me a shot to grow and to be involved in great projects that many would only dream of. Telerik helped put me on the map and I am forever grateful to them for giving me the opportunity. Leaving is tough, but another adventure awaits.

With that being said, I'm excited to announce that I'll be joining Microsoft at the end of November, working on the [Objective-C Bridge](https://dev.windows.com/en-us/bridges/ios) for UWP apps. With this new opportunity comes challenges, but I'm ready for my next undertaking. I look forward to pushing myself to be better in all aspects of my new position. If you're an iOS developer, then stay tuned because we have exciting announcements coming! 

Thanks again to all my co-workers, friends and customers that I've met while working at Telerik. Continue to be awesome! This isn't goodbye - it's see you later.
