<p>I have a new cover story article published in print and online in Visual Studio Magazine today called “<a href="http://visualstudiomagazine.com/articles/2012/08/01/new-metro-views.aspx">New Views on Windows 8 Metro-Style Development</a>”. This article takes a look at the FlipView ListView and GridView controls new for Windows 8 Metro-style applications. They'll become key tools for building great-looking UIs. See below for more information and a link to the online article in case you don’t get a print copy.</p>  <h3>Article Introduction</h3>  <p>With Windows 8 and Visual Studio 2012 getting closer to general availability Microsoft-focused developers are starting to pay closer attention. They're not only trying to understand the ins and outs of Windows 8 but are also wrapping their heads around a new runtime called Windows Runtime (WinRT).</p>  <p>WinRT is the new Microsoft programming model to build Metro-style apps using Windows 8. One of the challenges developers face with WinRT is learning how to use the new controls introduced with the release: FlipView ListView and GridView.</p>  <p>While the controls sound similar they're different in many ways. Read on to learn how and when to use each.</p>  <h3>The Full Article</h3>  <p>The full article is hosted on Visual Studio Magazine and you can access it by clicking <a href="http://visualstudiomagazine.com/articles/2012/08/01/new-metro-views.aspx">here</a>.
