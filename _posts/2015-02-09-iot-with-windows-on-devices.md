## Article Introduction

I have a new in-depth article published online today called, “IoT with Windows on Devices”.

In other words, humans could easily assign an IP address to every “thing” on the planet. It isn’t very surprising that we have started to see them being included in “things” such as heart monitoring implants, smart thermostats and garage door openers that use WiFi for remote monitoring.
