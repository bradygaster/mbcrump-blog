I have worked very hard on this series and am pleased with the work. I may be a little biased but I believe this is the best step-by-step guide ever created for OData and Silverlight/WP7 Mango. In the series I walk you through every step with detailed screenshot and code snippets. From creating the OData data service to consuming it in an Silverlight application to performing CRUD operation in Windows Phone 7 Mango. The entire article series spans 63 pages and is divided into 4 chapters. I hope you enjoy reading it as much as I did writing it. </p>  <p><strong>The Articles</strong></p>  <p>All of the content of the e-Book is available <strong>free</strong> of charge to anyone who wants to learn.
