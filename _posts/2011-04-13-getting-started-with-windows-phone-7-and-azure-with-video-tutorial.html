Now before we get started learning about it let’s take a look at the definition:</p>  <p>The <b>Windows Azure Platform</b><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azure_Services_Platform#cite_note-Windows_Azure_Platform-1">[2]</a></sup> is a Microsoft <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_platform">cloud platform</a> used to build host and scale web applications through Microsoft datacenters. Windows Azure Platform is thus classified as<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service">platform as a service</a> and forms part of Microsoft's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing">cloud computing</a> strategy along with their<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service">software as a service</a> offering <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Online_Services">Microsoft Online Services</a>.     <br /><em>(information taken from </em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azure_Services_Platform"><em>WikiPedia</em></a><em>)</em></p>  <p>So in other words think of cloud computing. I always believe that the best way to learn something is to jump straight into it and fill the gaps as you go. So let’s begin. In this <a href="http://www.silverlightshow.net/items/Getting-started-with-Windows-Phone-7-and-Azure.aspx">article</a> I am going to show you how to get started working with Windows Phone 7 and Azure. We are going to download the tools and create a new project starting from File-&gt;New Project. After that we will set up our users and add some data with our Windows Phone 7 Emulator. </p>  <p><strong>The Full Article</strong></p>  <p>The full article is hosted on SilverlightShow and you can access it by clicking <a href="http://www.silverlightshow.net/items/Getting-started-with-Windows-Phone-7-and-Azure.aspx">here</a>.
