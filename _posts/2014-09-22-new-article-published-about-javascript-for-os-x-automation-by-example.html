<p>I have a new in-depth article published online today called “<a href="http://developer.telerik.com/featured/javascript-os-x-automation-example/" target="_blank">JavaScript for OS X Automation by Example</a>”.</p>  <p>See below for more information and a link to the online article.</p>  <h6>Article Introduction</h6>  <p>Intro:</p>  <p>Apple is very close to releasing a new operating system called Yosemite. Everyone has been talking about iOS 8 iPhone 6 iPhone 6 Plus and watches but one important feature was <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/mac/releasenotes/InterapplicationCommunication/RN-JavaScriptForAutomation/index.html">JavaScript for OS X Automation</a>. While it may have been overlooked by journalists it was not overlooked by <a href="http://www.telerik.com/">Telerik</a>. Burke Holland created an <a href="http://developer.telerik.com/featured/apples-biggest-announcement-yet-isnt-phones-watches/">excellent post</a> that described how JavaScript is now a first-class citizen. In this post I am going to show you how you can use JavaScript for OS X Automation since there is hardly any information on it besides the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/mac/releasenotes/InterapplicationCommunication/RN-JavaScriptForAutomation/index.html">preliminary documentation</a> on Apple’s site.</p>  <h6>The Full Article</h6>  <p>The full article is hosted on the TDN website and you can access it by clicking <a href="http://developer.telerik.com/featured/javascript-os-x-automation-example/">here</a>. Don’t forget to rate it and leave comments if you have any problems.</p>
