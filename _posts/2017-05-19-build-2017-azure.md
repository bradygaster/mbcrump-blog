## Intro

Here are my full notes from the first day of the Build 2017 keynote for the busy developer. I try to get straight to the point and leave links where appropriate. I compiled these notes by watching the video that was posted [online](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DU23gG0geiQ). Keep in mind that I did a light pass on the notes, and am happy to take corrections.

I'm [@mbcrump](http://twitter.com/mbcrump) on Twitter if you would like daily updates on what is happening in .NET. 

## Satya Nadella CEO, MS - Opening Keynote

## Mobile-first, Cloud-first

Stats

* 500 Million Windows 10 monthly active devices
* 100 million commercial Office 365 monthly active users
* 140 million Cortana monthly active users
* 12 million organizations in Azure active directory
* Greater than 90% fortune 500 using Microsoft Cloud

## Big bucket pillars

- Agents and Bots
- Natural and conversational user interfaces
- Mixed Reality
- Artificial Intelligence
- Advanced analytics and work-flows
- IoT

3 Fundamental characteristics of this new world view

* Multi-device
* AI
* Serverless

## Announcing [Azure IoT Edge](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/campaigns/iot-edge/)

IoT Edge provides easy orchestration between code and services, so they flow securely between cloud and edge to distribute intelligence across IoT devices. Easily integrate Microsoft Azure and third-party services, or augment existing services to create a custom IoT application with your own business logic. You get the best of both worlds with devices that can act locally based on the data they generate, while also taking advantage of the cloud to configure, deploy, and manage them securely and at scale.

They showed a demo with [Sandvik](http://www.home.sandvik/en/) Group which uses this. 

## AI in the Workplace

Demo showing safety in the workplace that used MS Azure Stack, Azure Functions, Cognitive Services and commodity cameras.

It tracks people, equipment and what they are doing. 

They search: 

	Where is a Jackhammer? 
	Show that Jackhammer is in unstable orientation in the workshop

	Show me non employees on the job site
	It shows people that have already had their photo taken and they select the person and add them and create a new policy. 

	Only credentialed employees can use jackhammers. 
	Non authorized people get a notification 


## Discussion about [Microsoft Graph](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/)

Presenting : Laura Jones

She talks to Cortana and is able to set her time off. She pushes reminders to her car and it could have went to Xbox. With help of Cortana, she is on her way. Cortana finds a highway accident and she reminds her teammates that she will be last. Reminder to pull designers for project and she searches LinkedIn. Cortana provides the next best step. She connects to her meeting and they show MS Teams in Office 365. 

[Project Rome SDK](https://github.com/Microsoft/project-rome) is talked about and gives connected experiences in meetings. 

[Harman/Kardon Invoke](http://www.harmankardon.com/invoke.html) with Cortana from Microsoft was shown.

You pay only for what you use.

Only DB with Comprehensive SLAs across 4 dimensions:

- High availability
- Performance Latency
- Performance Throughput
- Data Consistency

We guarantee single millisecond response time at the 99th percentile as one of the SLAs that is built-in. This is a game-changer and you can monitor that SLA inside the portal. 

[JET.com](http://jet.com) runs entirely on Azure. 

* 31 million SKUs.
