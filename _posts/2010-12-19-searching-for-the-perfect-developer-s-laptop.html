<p>I have been in the market for a new computer for several months. I set out with a budget of around $1200. I knew up front that the machine would be used for developing applications and maybe some light gaming. I kept switching between buying a laptop or a desktop but the laptop won because:</p>  <p><em>With a Laptop I can carry it everywhere and with a desktop I can’t.</em> </p>  <p>I searched for about 2 weeks and narrowed it down to a list of must-have’s :</p>  <ol>   <li>i7 Processor (I wasn’t going to settle for an i5 or AMD. I wanted a true Quad-core machine not 2 dual-core fused together). </li>    <li>15.6” monitor </li>    <li>SSD 128GB or Larger. – It’s almost 2011 and I don’t want an old standard HDD in this machine. </li>    <li>8GB of DDR3 Ram. – The more the better right? </li>    <li>1GB Video Card (Prefer NVidia) – I might want to play games with this. </li>    <li>HDMI Port – Almost a standard on new Machines. This would be used when I am on the road and want to stream Netflix to the HDTV in the Hotel room. </li>    <li>Webcam Built-in – This would be to video chat with the wife and kids if I am on the road. </li>    <li>6-Cell Battery. – I’ve read that an i7 in a laptop really kills the battery. A 6-cell or 9-cell is even better. </li> </ol>  <p>That is a pretty long list for a budget of around $1200. I searched around the internet and could not buy this machine prebuilt for under $1200. That was even with coupons and my company’s 10% Dell discount. The only way that I would get a machine like this was to buy a prebuilt and replace parts. </p>  <p>I chose the&#160; <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16834146848&amp;cm_re=y560-_-34-146-848-_-Product">Lenovo Y560</a> on Newegg to start as my base. Below is a top-down picture of it. </p>  <p><a href="http://michaelcrump.net/files/image_634591197657314743.png"><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://michaelcrump.net/files/image_thumb_634591197685551105.png" width="453" height="306" /></a></p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p><strong>Part 1: The Hardware</strong></p>  <p>The Specs for this machine: </p> <dl><dt>Color :&#160; Gray</dt><dt>Operating System : Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit</dt><dt>CPU Type : Intel Core i7-740QM(1.73GHz)</dt><dt>Screen : 15.6&quot; WXGA</dt><dt>Memory Size : 4GB DDR3</dt><dt>Hard Disk : 500GB</dt><dt>Optical Drive : DVD±R/RW</dt><dt>Graphics Card : ATI Mobility Radeon HD 5730</dt><dt>Video Memory : 1GB</dt><dt>Communication : Gigabit LAN and WLAN</dt><dt>Card slot : 1 x Express Card/34</dt><dt>Battery Life : Up to 3.5 hours</dt><dt>Dimensions : 15.20&quot; x 10.00&quot; x 0.80&quot; - 1.30&quot;</dt><dt>Weight : 5.95 lbs.</dt></dl>  <p>This computer met most of the requirements above except that it didn’t come with an <u>SSD</u> or have <u>8GB of DDR3 Memory</u>. So I needed to start shopping except this time for an SSD. I asked around on twitter and other hardware forums and everyone pointed me to the <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820148348&amp;cm_re=crucial_c300-_-20-148-348-_-Product">Crucial C300 SSD</a>. After checking prices of the drive it was going to cost an extra $275 bucks and I was going from a spacious 500GB drive to 128GB. After watching some of the SSD videos on YouTube I started feeling better. Below is a pic of the Crucial C300 SSD. </p>  <p><a href="http://michaelcrump.net/files/IMG_0854_634591197729231665.jpg"><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="IMG_0854" border="0" alt="IMG_0854" src="http://michaelcrump.net/files/IMG_0854_thumb_634591197741243819.jpg" width="450" height="338" /></a></p>  <p>The second thing that I needed to upgrade was the RAM. It came with 4GB of DDR3 RAM but it was slow. I decided to buy the Crucial 8GB (4GB x 2) Kit from <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820148276">Newegg</a>. This RAM cost an extra $120 and had a CAS Latency of 7. </p>  <p><a href="http://michaelcrump.net/files/image_634591197790072445.png"><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://michaelcrump.net/files/image_thumb_634591197847793185.png" width="318" height="446" /></a></p>  <p>In the end this machine delivered everything that I wanted and it cost around $1300. You are probably saying well your budget was $1200. I have spare parts that I’m planning on selling on eBay or Anandtech.&#160; =) If you are interested then shoot me an email and I will give you a great deal mbcrump[at]gmail[dot]com. </p>  <ol>   <li>500GB Laptop 7200RPM HDD </li>    <li>4GB of DDR3 RAM (2GB x 2) </li>    <li><a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16826577001">faceVision HD 720p Camera</a> – Unopened </li> </ol>  <p>In the end my Windows Experience Rating of the SSD was 7.7 and the CPU 7.1. The max that you can get is a 7.9. </p>  <p><strong>Part 2: The Software</strong></p>  <p>I’m very lucky that I get a lot of software for free. When choosing a laptop the OS really doesn’t matter because I would never keep the bloatware pre-installed or Windows 7 Home Premium on my main development machine. Matter of fact as soon as I got the laptop I immediately took out the old HDD without booting into it. After I got the SSD into the machine I installed Windows 7 Ultimate 64-Bit. The BIOS was out of date so I updated that to the latest version and started downloading drivers off of Lenovo’s site. I had to download the Wireless Networking Drivers to a USB-Key before I could get my machine on my wireless network. I also discovered that if the date on your computer is off then you cannot join the Windows 7 Homegroup until you fix it. </p>  <p>I’m aware that most people like peeking into what programs other software developers use and I went ahead and listed my “essentials” of a fresh build. I am a big Silverlight guy so naturally some of the software listed below is specific to Silverlight.
