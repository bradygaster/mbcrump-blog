<h3>Thank you... </h3>  <p><strong>Seriously</strong></p>  <p>I’ve been reflecting over 2012 and thinking of all the new people that I met and the new experiences that I’ve had. I thought of wrapping it all up into a year-end “wrap-up” blog post but instead I just wanted to simply say “<strong>Thank you</strong>”. Every last one of you – from my family to my employer (<a href="http://www.telerik.com/">Telerik</a>) to my friends to the various people and organizations that have let me speak and write for them to my blog readers and various twitter followers. *whew* I hope I didn’t miss anyone!</p>  <p>I’ve been truly blessed in 2012 and to be honest with you I would be <strong><em>nothing</em></strong> without the support from everyone. I’m extremely humbled to of had so many opportunities in 2012 and so many new ones opening up in 2013. From new speaking and writing opportunities and much much more! Again I owe this all to you. </p>  <p>I wish each and everyone of you a great 2013 and thank you for helping me grow not only as a developer but as a person. </p>  <p>-Michael Crump (<a href="https://twitter.com/mbcrump/">@mbcrump</a>)</p>
