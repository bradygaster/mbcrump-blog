"Hello World" is commonly known in the developer community for the first program that you created or the simplest. Iâ€™ve recently published my first YouTube video called "Hello World" as it is my first YouTube video. It is a channel introduction that describes why I'm doing it and what I'll be covering. I've also added closed captions in English. 

Here is the video, I hope you enjoy it and don't forget to email me questions at michael@michaelcrump.net.
