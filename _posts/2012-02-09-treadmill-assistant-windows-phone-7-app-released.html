You can enter and store dates ran duration miles ran and notes. You can also view your run log and email it to yourself. The application is free so give it a shot today!</p>  <h3>Why a Treadmill app?</h3>  <p>Back in December 2011 I decided that it was time to start losing weight. So what did I do? I made a lifestyle change – not a fad diet. I decided that I would start eating healthier foods and allow myself one cheat day. I also started an exercise program using a treadmill and light weights. I started running 3.5 miles a day at least 4 days a week. After running for about a month I decided that it would be interesting to keep track of my runs in a calendar view.&#160; So what did I do? I looked for an existing WP7 app that had the functionality I wanted. I found several apps but they seemed to never fit the bill so I just went ahead and built my own. Surprising isn’t it? :)</p>  <h3>The App</h3>  <p>Just like all of my other personal adventures this app was built whenever I had free time. Nowadays that is few and far between with two kids a wife and a very sick mother-in-law. So I used a mixture of tools including <a href="http://www.telerik.com/products/windows-phone.aspx">Telerik’s WP7 controls</a>. I decided that I’d also try out the local database feature in Mango as well to become familiar with it. I wound up creating several helper classes that I should be able to reuse in other apps. The app was fun to build as it solved my problem flawlessly. </p>  <h3>What’s Next?</h3>  <p>I’m going to add charting and several quick glimpse screens. Those screens would tell the amount of miles ran in a month calories burned and so forth. I also plan on adding some additional polish to the app as the current state is functional (at least to me) but could improve. I’ll also add a product page similar to this one I used for FullScreen Browser. ( <a href="http://michaelcrump.net/fsb/">product page</a> ) If you download the app and have any questions or comments then feel free to post them below. I’ve added a few screenshots below so you can get a taste of what it is like.</p>  <h3>Screenshots</h3>  <p><a href="http://michaelcrump.net/files/1_634643239184846440.png"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="1" border="0" alt="1" src="http://michaelcrump.net/files/1_thumb_634643239191554483.png" width="177" height="293" /></a><a href="http://michaelcrump.net/files/6_634643239208402591.png"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="6" border="0" alt="6" src="http://michaelcrump.net/files/6_thumb_634643239214954633.png" width="177" height="292" /></a><a href="http://michaelcrump.net/files/2_634643239229462726.png"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="2" border="0" alt="2" src="http://michaelcrump.net/files/2_thumb_634643239235702766.png" width="176" height="291" /></a></p>  <p><a href="http://michaelcrump.net/files/4_634643239246310834.png"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="4" border="0" alt="4" src="http://michaelcrump.net/files/4_thumb_634643239251302866.png" width="176" height="290" /></a><a href="http://michaelcrump.net/files/7_634643239265810959.png"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="7" border="0" alt="7" src="http://michaelcrump.net/files/7_thumb_634643239271582996.png" width="173" height="285" /></a><a href="http://michaelcrump.net/files/5_634643239292799132.png"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="5" border="0" alt="5" src="http://michaelcrump.net/files/5_thumb_634643239299975178.png" width="173" height="285" /></a></p>  <p><a href="http://michaelcrump.net/files/3_634643239320879312.png"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="3" border="0" alt="3" src="http://michaelcrump.net/files/3_thumb_634643239327899357.png" width="173" height="285" /></a></p>
