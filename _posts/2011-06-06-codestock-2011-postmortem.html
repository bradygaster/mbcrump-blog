We were driving from Birmingham Alabama so it was going to take us about 4.5 hours to get in. After stopping a few times we finally arrived at the Knoxville Hilton. After checking into our rooms we met <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/kemmis">Rafe Kemmis</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/SpedeBryan">Spede Bryan</a> in the lobby and headed over to <a href="http://www.barleystaproom.com/knoxville/">Barley's Taproom and Pizzeria</a> in the Knoxville Old City. It didn’t take long for <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/wbm">Wallace B. McClure</a> to show up and we talked Mono for a while. Shortly after that the DevExpress crew dropped in (<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/sethjuarez">Seth Juarez</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/BryanDevx">Bryan Wood</a>) and we continued the conversation. We finally made it to a table and I ordered an awesome grilled chicken sandwich. While there I saw a lot of familiar faces including <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/alanstevens">Alan Stevens</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/vinull">Michael Neel</a>. After chatting and meeting/making some new friends we headed back to the hotel to get some rest from the day. </p>  <p>Day Two (Friday)</p>  <p>I got up Friday morning and headed downstairs to grab some coffee with <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/dbh01">Daniel Heisler</a> and ran into <a title="http://www.twitter.com/JustinEtheredge" href="http://www.twitter.com/JustinEtheredge">Justin Etheredge</a>. It was great chatting with him for a while! We then quickly headed over to the conference center to get registered. I was expecting a long registration process but it took a matter of seconds. Anyways after getting registered I started walking around and ran into <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/jeremylikness">Jeremy Likness</a>. Since we are both big Silverlight guys we chatted for a while and decided to continue the conversation at lunch. <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/danmoyer">Dan Moyer</a> a guy who reads my blog came up and introduced himself to me. It was great getting some feedback on what kind of content the community is looking for. I decided that my first session was going to be HTML5 vs. Silverlight by Matt Casto ( <a href="http://twitter.com/mattcasto">@mattcasto</a> ). This turned out to be a very interesting session and the final answer was… it depends. If you didn’t get a chance to check it out then you can see it again at <a href="http://devlink.net/">devLINK</a>. My next session was Kinect Hacks 101 by James Ashley ( <a href="http://twitter.com/jamesashley">@jamesashley</a> ). James showed us the awesome open-source project for Kinect development called <a href="http://openkinect.org/wiki/Main_Page">Open-Kinect</a>. The session made me want to run out and buy a Kinect just to play with this cool stuff. After the session I hung around and introduced myself to James Ashley and we have both been blogging on SL/WP7 for a while.&#160; My third session for the day was actually lunch and I met up with <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/jeremylikness">Jeremy Likness</a> and we talked about SL5 Sterling and other tech things. After lunch was over I attended his SL5 LOB application talk as I’m a big fan of Jeremy’s work and it was a great session. He created a nice sample browser of <a href="http://csharperimage.jeremylikness.com/2011/06/codestock-presentation-silverlight-5.html">SL5 demos</a> and made it public on his website and I would recommend you check them out. The last session that I attended was an “Intro to Ruby on Rails” by Rod Paddock ( <a href="http://twitter.com/rodpaddock">@rodpaddock</a> ). I wanted to mix things up and get a fresh perspective on another language and definitely did so with Rod’s session. I decided that I’d build my first Rails application after watching his presentation. It also was great that he gave everyone in the room a free subscription to Code Magazine. Since that was the last session of the day I headed to my hotel room for about an hour. At 4:45PM I headed over to the Bijou Theater for a keynote by Charles Petzold. While standing in line for food I actually got to meet Charles Petzold and talk about some of his books in line. That was a great moment at CodeStock for me as I’ve read his books over the years and his “Applications = Code + Markup” was one of the books that got me into XAML. After the keynote was over <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/vinull">Michael Neel</a> gave away a lot of great prizes to the audience. Since I had a session the next morning we decided to grab something to eat beside the theatre and head back. I stayed up and practiced my 8:30AM session at least 3 times before heading to bed.&#160;&#160; </p>  <p>Day Three (Saturday)</p>  <p>I got up very early on Saturday morning and headed over to the convention center to make sure everything was setup and ready for my session. I noticed that my session was in the auditorium and was expecting a full house. A few people started coming in around 8AM and I tried to introduce myself to most of them. So 8:30AM arrived and I started right on time as I had a lot to cover in 70 minutes. I believe the session went very well I tried to keep the audience involved in the conversation and adjusted the amount of time that I spent on a tool to what the audience already knew about it. I had some great feedback on twitter from <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/thnk2wn/statuses/77006219348410368">Geoff Hudik</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/CGULGAS/statuses/77009720770170880">Constantine Gulgas</a> and a few emails in the inbox in the morning. The questions that the audience asked were great questions and some made me really think. After my session was over I decided to attend “Intro to Test Driven Development by James Bender ( <a href="http://twitter.com/jamesbender">@jamesbender</a> ). It was another great session as he kept the audience involved. I had to leave the session a tad early to get check out of the hotel and I was starving as I hadn’t eaten breakfast or had my coffee due to my morning session and my OCD to have everything just right before my session started. During lunch I was able to eat with James Ashley ( <a href="http://twitter.com/jamesashley">@jamesashley</a> ) and we continued talking about the Kinect and other interesting projects we were all working on. The next session that I decided to attend was an “Open Spaces” which was named “How to Suck Less”. I found the open spaces session excellent as our group was very large and most everyone was contributing to the conversation. After the session was over I was interviewed by <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/BryanDevx">Bryan Wood</a> on some of the cool Silverlight/WP7 projects that I had been working on. I then headed to what would be my last session of the day Field Survival Guide for the Budding Entrepreneur by Michael Brown ( <a href="http://twitter.com/browniepoints">@browniepoints</a> ). Michael had a great session with a lot of audience participation. We then decided to call it a day and head back to Birmingham AL. </p>  <p>Overall the conference rocked and I wanted to say a big thank you to Michael Neel and his wife and everyone else involved in organizing this event. It is an absolute steal for $60 and I would recommend it to everyone. </p>  <p>I wanted to give a big thanks to my employer <a href="http://www.pointclearsolutions.com/">Point Clear Solutions</a> for allowing me to attend Cod
