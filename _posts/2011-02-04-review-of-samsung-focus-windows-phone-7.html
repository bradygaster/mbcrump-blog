<p>I recently acquired a <a href="http://www.samsung.com/us/mobile/cell-phones/SGH-I917ZKAATT">Samsung Focus Windows Phone 7</a> device from AT&amp;T and wanted to share what I thought of it as an end-user. </p>  <p><strong><u>Samsung Focus i917</u></strong></p>  <p><strong>Phone Size:</strong> Perfect! I have been carrying around a Dell Streak (Android) and it is about half the size. It is really nice to have a phone that fits in your pocket without a lot of extra bulk. I bought a case for the Focus and it is still a perfect size.&#160; The phone just feels right.     <br /><strong>Screen:</strong> It has a beautiful Super AMOLED 480x800 screen. I only wish it supported a higher resolution. The colors are beautiful especially in an Xbox Live Game.&#160;&#160; <br /><strong>3G:</strong> I use AT&amp;T and I've had spotty reception. This really can't be blamed on the phone as much as the actual carrier.     <br /><strong>Battery:</strong> I've had excellent battery life compared to my iPhone and Android devices. I usually use my phone throughout the day on and off and still have a charge at the end of the day.&#160; <br /><strong>Camera/Video:</strong> I'm still looking for the option to send the video to YouTube or the Image to Twitter. The images look good but the phone needs a forward facing camera. I like the iPhone/Android (Dell Streak) camera better.     <br /><strong>Built-in Speaker</strong>: Sounds great. It’s not a wimpy speaker that you cannot hear.&#160; <br /><strong>CPU:</strong> Very smooth transitioning from one screen to another. The prototype Windows Phone 7 that I had was no where near as smooth. (It was also running a slower processor though).     <br /><strong>OS:</strong> I actually like the OS but a few things could be better. </p>  <p><strong>CONS: </strong></p>  <ol>   <li>Copy and Paste (Supposed to come in the next update) </li>    <li>We need more apps (Pandora missing was a big one for me and Slacker’s advertisement sucks!). As time passes and more developers get on board then this will be fixed. </li>    <li>The browser needs some major work. I have tried to make cross-platform (WP7 Android iPhone and iPad) web apps and the browser that ships with WP7 just can’t handle it.&#160; </li>    <li>Apps need to be organized better. Instead of throw them all on one screen it would help to allow the user to create categories. </li> </ol>  <p><strong>PROS:</strong></p>  <ol>   <li>Hands down the best gaming experience on a phone. I have all three major phones (iphone android and wp7). Nothing compares to the gaming experience on the WP7. </li>    <li>The phone just works. I’ve had a <strong>LOT</strong> of glitches with my Android device. I’ve had maybe 2 with my WP7 device. Exchange and Office support are great. </li>    <li>Nice integration with Twitter/Facebook and social media. </li>    <li>Easy to navigate and find the information you need on one screen. </li> </ol>  <p>Let’s look at a few pictures and we will wrap up with my final thoughts on the phone. </p>  <p>WP7 Home Screen. </p>  <p>   <br /><a href="http://michaelcrump.net/files/image11_634591068742878325.png"><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://michaelcrump.net/files/image11_thumb_634591068812611219.png" width="465" height="348" /></a></p>  <p>Back of the phone is as stylish. </p>  <p><a href="http://michaelcrump.net/files/image5_634591068958785093.png"><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://michaelcrump.net/files/image5_thumb_634591069035694079.png" width="462" height="345" /></a></p>  <p>It is hard to see due to the shadow but it is a very thin phone. </p>  <p><a href="http://michaelcrump.net/files/image8_634591069178279907.png"><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://michaelcrump.net/files/image8_thumb_634591069252692861.png" width="458" height="346" /></a></p>  <p>What’s included? </p>  <ul>   <li>Manuals </li>    <li>Ear buds </li>    <li>Data Cable plus Power Adapter </li>    <li>Phone </li> </ul>  <p><em>Click a picture to enlarge</em></p>  <p><a href="http://michaelcrump.net/files/image14_634591069381706515.png"><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://michaelcrump.net/files/image14_thumb_634591069410722887.png" width="285" height="215" /></a><a href="http://michaelcrump.net/files/image17_634591069535836491.png"><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://michaelcrump.net/files/image17_thumb_634591069563448845.png" width="284" height="214" /></a><a href="http://michaelcrump.net/files/image20_634591069695582539.png"><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://michaelcrump.net/files/image20_thumb_634591069723662899.png" width="286" height="214" /></a></p>  <p><strong>So what are my final thoughts on the Phone/OS?</strong></p>  <p>I love the Samsung Focus and would recommend it to anyone looking for a WP7 device. Like any first generation product you need to give it a little while to mature. Right now the phone is missing several features that we are all used to using. That doesn’t mean a year from now it will be in the same situation. (I sure hope we won’t). If you are looking to get into mobile development I believe WP7 is the easiest platform to develop from. This is especially true if you have a background in Silverlight or WPF. </p>
