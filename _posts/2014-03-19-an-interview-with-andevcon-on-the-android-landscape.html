<h4>Introduction</h4>  <p>I was recently interviewed by <a href="http://www.andevcon.com/">Michael Pehel</a> on all sorts of topics ranging from how I got started in programming to my thoughts on the Android landscape. It was a fun interview and I hope to be invited back again some time. </p>  <h4>Interview</h4>  <p>You can read the interview by visiting this <a href="http://andevcon.com/article-qa.aspx?ArticleID=68800&amp;page=1">page</a>.</p>  <p>Also: If you use the code <strong>CRUMP</strong> it acts a $200 discount code which can be applied to any three and four-day passport registration. So with the current pricing (<a href="http://andevcon.com/registrationdetails.html)">http://andevcon.com/registrationdetails.html)</a> you can technically save $650 before March 21 with your discount code. </p>  <p>You can also learn more about <a href="http://www.telerik.com/">Telerikâ€™s</a> involvement with Android at this <a href="http://www.telerik.com/android-ui">page</a>. </p>  <p>Thanks for reading.</p>
