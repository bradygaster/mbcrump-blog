There really isn’t any way to get around this. You can have the best looking user interface and a personal assistant who knows your cat’s name but without high quality apps the platform will fall flat. Amongst the apps comes many challenges for mobile developers but one in particular is the challenge to get meaningful feedback from the customer to the developer. You want 5 stars right? In this article we will take a look at why feedback is so important and then look at how several major brands implemented it as well as how Telerik is innovating in this space.</p>  <h4>The Full Article</h4>  <p>The full article is hosted on the TDN website and you can access it by clicking <a href="http://developer.telerik.com/featured/gathering-meaningful-feedback-ios-apps/" target="_blank">here</a>.
