This is a book that I worked on for approximately 10 weeks with the goal of teaching other developers all of the new features in Silverlight 5 in one short e-Book. If you want to learn about Silverlight 5 then go ahead and grab a copy and put it on your iPad Kindle Fire PC or other device and read a chapter a night. I hope you find the book useful and if you have any comments then please leave them below. </p>  <h3>The Roadmap for the e-Book</h3>  <p>Below you will find the list of topics that we discussed in this book.
