Hey everyone   <p>I was recently quoted by Janet Tu for the <a href="http://seattletimes.com/">Seattle Times</a>. It was in regards to their pre-Build coverage.&#160; The title of the article is “<a href="http://seattletimes.com/html/businesstechnology/2021250630_microsoftbuildxml.html">Windows 8.1 top priority at Build meeting</a>” and you can read it online. Feel free to leave comments here or through twitter. I just thought I’d share my take on the upcoming conference happening tomorrow!</p>  <p>Thanks</p>  <p>Michael</p>
