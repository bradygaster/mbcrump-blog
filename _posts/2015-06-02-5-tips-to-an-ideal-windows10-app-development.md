## Article Introduction

I’ve recently released an article on TDN title, "5 Steps to an Ideal Windows 10 App Development Environment". In it, I share lessons learned from setting up my Win 10 Dev environment. 

## Tip #1

### Start with a Clean Slate

The Windows 10 SDK works best on a Windows 10 OS. You have a variety of ways to install the OS on your system.

You can upgrade Windows 8.1 to Windows 10.
You can download the Windows 10 ISO.
I had several problems upgrading a Windows 8.1 box, so I elected to install the Windows 10 ISO on a clean hard drive.

The next issue that I ran into was how exactly do I create a bootable USB drive that doesn’t require “diskpart”. I quickly found a program called, “Rufus” that will allow you to create a bootable USB drive with just a couple of clicks. As a matter of fact, the only thing that I had to change was just to point to the .ISO file that I downloaded earlier.

## The Other Tips

The remaining 4 tips, plus a bonus one is hosted on the TDN website and you can access it [here](http://developer.telerik.com/featured/5-steps-to-an-ideal-windows-10-app-development-environment/).
