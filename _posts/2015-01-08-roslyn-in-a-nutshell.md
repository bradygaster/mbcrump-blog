### Excerpt 

Roslyn is made up of the open-source C# and Visual Basic compilers and code analysis APIs for Microsoft’s development stack. Very few people realize that Roslyn came out in October 2011 as a preview that worked with Visual Studio 2010 SP1. While there has been several changes since 2011, it really took the spotlight at the //Build conference held in 2014 when Microsoft open-sourced it and made it available for Visual Studio 2013.
