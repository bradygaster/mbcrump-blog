<p><img src="http://weblogs.asp.net/blogs/hajan/badges/MVP550x222.png" width="357" height="144" /></p>  <p>I found out last night that I have been awarded with the Microsoft MVP Award for my contribution to the Silverlight community. It is a honor a privilege and one of the biggest moments in my professional life. I cannot tell you how excited that I am to be acknowledged by Microsoft for doing something that I love. </p>  <p>According to Microsoft this award is given by Microsoft to outstanding members of Microsoft's technical communities based on contributions made during the previous 12 months to offline and online Microsoft-related technical communities. Of 100 million technical community participants worldwide about 5000 are MVPs. Outstanding technical community members are nominated by their peers Microsoft employees and MVPs. Each year a panel of Microsoft employees reviews the contributions of each nominee for quality quantity and level of impact on the technical community.</p>  <p>I would like to say thanks to Microsoft for giving me this award my friends family co-workers blog readers other community leaders and everyone else who has encouraged me and supported my efforts.</p>  <p><strong>So why did you wait so late to tell us? </strong></p>  <p>I can hear your tweets DMâ€™s and emails so let me tell you now. It is because the email address that Microsoft had was incorrect. My MVP Lead corrected it last night and I just got the email. </p>  <p>Thanks again to everyone</p>
