## Article Introduction

I have a new in-depth article published online today called, “A Succinct Look at Windows 10 Tools for Developers”. 

### Excerpt 

A lot has change since we first looked at Windows 10 in November of last year. As we have been updating our machines to the latest build, a very important announcement came out last week introducing the Windows 10 Technical Preview for Developers. While we are all excited about the new features and functionality, it is often helpful to have someone break down what we need to know without visiting and dissecting multiple pages and watching several videos ourselves. This article aims to cover the bits that you need, as well as some additional resources to get started. I’ve also spent some time breaking down the major announcements and taking a look at the new Windows 10 project template.
