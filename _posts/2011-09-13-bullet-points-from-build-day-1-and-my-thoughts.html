<p>&#160;</p>  <p>I usually do a bullet points from major conference events like this one from <a href="http://michaelcrump.net/archive/2011/04/13/bullet-points-from-mix11-day-2-ndashwp7-silverlight-and-kinect.aspx">Mix11</a>. The purpose of this post is to get you up to speed quickly with news and links you may enjoy. </p>  <p><strong>Build – Day 1 Keynote</strong></p>  <ul>   <li>Windows 8 takes about half the amount of RAM to run compared to Windows 7. </li>    <li>Windows 7 usage by consumers is now greater than Windows XP. </li>    <li>Like the Metro Interface? Well you better as the interface is similar to the Windows Phone 7. </li>    <li>You can unlock your touch-enabled PC by tapping certain spots on a picture. Even using swipe gestures. </li>    <li>Want to use a keyboard/mouse instead of touch? Well you can so stop worrying. </li>    <li>Get used to the word – Charms. </li>    <li>You can use either XAML/C#/VB/C++/C or HTML/JS/ to write Windows 8 Applications. </li>    <li>Expression Blend 5 will support HTML and CSS Editing as well as XAML. </li>    <li>Windows 8 will have better security with things such as Defender and the ability to detect malicious virus at the bootstrapper level. </li>    <li>Everything is hardware accelerated (uses the power of your GPU). </li>    <li>WinRT – Stands for Windows Runtime – 1800 Objects in their new API. </li>    <li>Spellcheck in everything; everywhere. </li>    <li>The new version of Visual Studio has templates to create metro applications. </li>    <li>There will be a new Windows Store that will allow you to deploy your application from within Visual Studio 11. </li>    <li>Microsoft provides guidance on how your app should look. </li>    <li>Windows Store lets you determine the price/trial period of your app. Includes a certification process. </li>    <li>Silverlight to Windows 8 looks painless. The demos included one line of code for Windows Phone 7. </li>    <li>Additional features for Accessibility. (It will increase tiles and so forth) </li>    <li>Windows 8 boots freakin’ fast. Some pcs were showing Windows 8 as fast as they could open the lid to the machine. </li>    <li>IE 10 is designed to be used for Windows 8. </li>    <li>Live DOM in Expression Blend allows Drag-and-Drop of Elements in HTML5. </li>    <li>Everyone in the audience got a tablet equipped with Windows 8 and tools necessary to build applications. </li>    <li>Multi-monitor support – think UltraMon but better. </li>    <li>If your PC has USB 3.0 support – Windows 8 will use it. File copy demo was amazing. </li>    <li>Windows 8 is not just for play. Several demos showed them using it with a mouse/keyboard combo. </li>    <li>Windows Live will allow you to connect devices together. Example: browser photos from other PCs. </li>    <li>ASUS and Toshiba have ultra-thin laptops under 2.5 lbs. </li> </ul>  <p><strong>My thoughts on the Keynote:</strong></p>  <p>Let me go ahead and say that I am excited about what I heard today. I am a Silverlight MVP and I also love Silverlight very much. But what I’m really in love with is XAML and C#.&#160; That is NOT going away with developing Windows 8 applications. We can take our existing XAML skills and write Windows 8 applications. This doesn’t mean our existing Silverlight applications won’t run as they will. Nor does it mean that we won’t be creating new Silverlight applications. <em>Silverlight 5 is being released at the end of this year</em>. </p>  <p>The Visual Studio 11 Templates for XAML/C# look very easy to build plus its just a few lines to convert Silverlight application into the Metro Interface (if that’s what you want). The same is true with developing Windows Phone 7 apps. I am also excited that we are getting support for HTML/JS in Blend 5. </p>  <p>I feel that Microsoft got this one right by addressing the tablet device and changing the look and feel of Windows. From the looks of things developers have a lot to be excited about in the future. </p>  <p><strong>Helpful Links: </strong></p>  <p><strong>Microsoft</strong></p>  <p><a href="http://dev.windows.com/">Windows 8 Platform Preview will be downloadable tonight around 8PM PST.
