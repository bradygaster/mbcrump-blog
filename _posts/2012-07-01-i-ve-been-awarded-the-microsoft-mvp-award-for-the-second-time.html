We are pleased to present you with the 2012 Microsoft® MVP Award! This award is given to exceptional technical community leaders who actively share their high quality real world expertise with others. We appreciate your outstanding contributions in Silverlight technical communities during the past year.</p>  <h3>Wrap-up</h3>  <p>I would like to thank my wife and kids <a href="http://www.microsoft.com">Microsoft</a> <a href="http://www.telerik.com/">Telerik</a> my MVP Lead (Dora Chan) the community and everyone else who has supported and believed in me. Thanks everyone and I hope to contribute even more to the community in the next year! </p>  <p>I also look forward to going to the MVP Summit next year! I had a blast at the last one. </p>  <p><iframe height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/6XEbtCb0ezA" frameborder="0" width="560" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
