While there have been many frameworks that have come and gone <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> is not one of those. AngularJS is backed by Google and is an MVC framework that allows you to define very powerful templates directly in your HTML and includes data binding and dependency injection which makes your code not only easier to write but for others to read.</p>  <h4>The Full Article</h4>  <p>The full article is hosted on the <a href="http://modernweb.com/" target="_blank">ModernWeb</a> and you can access it by clicking <a href="http://modernweb.com/2014/09/15/angularjs-one-step-time/" target="_blank">here</a>.
