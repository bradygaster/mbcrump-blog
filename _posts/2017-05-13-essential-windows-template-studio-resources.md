Just like the tool, I'd like to save you some time by highlighting some of the resources so far for Windows Template Studio. In case you missed it, at Build 2017, [Clint Rutkas](http://twitter.com/clintrutkas) and [I](http://twitter.com/mbcrump) announced [Windows Template Studio](https://github.com/Microsoft/WindowsTemplateStudio) which helps you scaffold a brand new UWP app with a friendly wizard, bringing together the pages, frameworks and features that you want. 

In other words, instead of starting with the blank UWP app template...

## Windows Template Studio is Open Source

Windows Template Studio is completely open-source and available now on [GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/WindowsTemplateStudio). We would love for you to contribute to the project and would encourage you to read our [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/Microsoft/WindowsTemplateStudio/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for next steps. 

**>** You can get to the open source repo quickly by going to [aka.ms/wts](http://aka.ms/wts).

## Install the VSIX, Create your App

If you have Visual Studio 2017 installed then it only requires for you to download and install the [Visual Studio extension from the marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=WASTeamAccount.WindowsTemplateStudio). After you install the extension, open Visual Studio 2017 and select File → New Project → C# → Windows Universal and you should see Windows Template Studio is now available as an option.

Clint Rutkas, [Matt Lacey](http://twitter.com/mrlacy) and I appeared on Channel 9 Live at Build and we recorded the following video on why we created Windows Template Studio and included a demonstration of us using it. We also answered questions live on the show.

[CodingBlocks.net](http://CodingBlocks.net) took 15 minutes to walk you through the New File Experience. 
In this video I'll give you a little tour of the new Windows Template Studio - a scaffolding tool that lets you quickly gets your idea off the ground and allows your to focus on the core application by NOT having to futz around with mundane things like navigation code, local storage mechanisms, localization, etc.
