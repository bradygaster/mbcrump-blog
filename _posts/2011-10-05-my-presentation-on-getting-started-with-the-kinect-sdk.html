The video quality is not that great but that is my fault. Our camera quit working and someone had to record the session with an iPad2. </p>  <h4>Abstract:</h4>  <p>This talk is also designed for people who want to get started developing with the official Microsoft Kinect SDK. I will walk the user through downloading the bits and starting a new project. We will take a look at several great free open-source tools to help jump-start your first NUI project.</p>  <h4>Recorded On:</h4>  <p>7/26/2011</p>  <h4>Recorded At:</h4>  <p>All About XAML UG <a href="http://www.allaboutxaml.net">http://www.allaboutxaml.net</a></p>
