## Updating your Apple Watch

You will begin by seeing their is an update available on your phone.

Once you click, "Download and Install", it will prompt you to enter your pin number.

You have to accept the terms and conditions as with any iOS software update.

It then downloads the installer onto your phone and begins "preparing" the update to be installed.

## Wrap-up

I know this is geeky, but I'm sure some people are interested in seeing this before they update their $400 or more watch. :)
