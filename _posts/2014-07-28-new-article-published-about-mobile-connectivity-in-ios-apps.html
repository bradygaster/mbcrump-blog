Regardless of when it happens it <em>usually</em> occurs during a call or when you need to look something up on the internet.</p>  <p>As mobile app developers we have faced this problem for many years. Even the simplest of apps typically need an internet connection even if it is to only display an iAd. More sophisticated apps may need an internet connection to store data back in the cloud whether it is a high score for a game or enterprise data logged by the CEO. Let’s take a step back and look at the current state of mobile connectivity in iOS apps.</p>  <h4>The Full Article</h4>  <p>The full article is hosted on the TDN website and you can access it by clicking <a href="http://developer.telerik.com/featured/mobile-connectivity-ios-apps/" target="_blank">here</a>.
