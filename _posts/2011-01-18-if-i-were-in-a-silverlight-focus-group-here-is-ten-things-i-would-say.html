 here is ten things I would say.<p><img src="http://www.austinundergroundfilm.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/focus-group-300x300.jpg" />&#160;</p>  <p>Silverlight is a great product right off the shelf. I use it love it and spend a lot of time helping the community understand it. This however doesn’t mean that I don’t think that it can get better. If I were invited to a Microsoft Focus Group about Silverlight here is 10 things I would say:&#160; </p>  <ol>   <li>We need more navigation templates.      <ul>       <li>I’ve <a href="http://michaelcrump.net/mbcrump/archive/2010/08/28/silverlight-4-application-template-themes-by-microsoft.aspx">found (4) templates</a> that Microsoft has released (Cosmo Windows 7 Accent and JetPack). This number needs to be around 16. In order to get more people developing for Silverlight we need to give them a variety of templates to get them off the ground quickly. </li>     </ul>   </li>    <li>Silverlight needs to ship with the next version of Windows.      <ul>       <li>At least version 4 needs to be pre-installed on Windows going forward. It’s small in its own sandbox and I cannot find a reason for it not to be included. </li>     </ul>   </li>    <li>Silverlight needs to run on more platforms.&#160; <ul>       <li>iOS and Android are the key here. I think Microsoft should shoot for Android first since I believe Android will take the lead in the mobile market (at least for the short-term). It would also be great to see Microsoft use Silverlight as the focus on their new tablets / “AppleTV”. I would even invest in getting it working with Kinect. </li>     </ul>   </li>    <li>When creating a new project in Silverlight we should have the option to create a Unit Test.      <ul>       <li>Most Silverlight developers are not unit testing. If this is surprising to you then you need to get out and talk to more developers. I partially blame this on Microsoft. When you create a new ASP.NET MVC application you simply put a check to create a Unit Test project. We need the same thing for Silverlight. We should steer the developer into the right direction. </li>     </ul>   </li>    <li>Design patterns such as MVVM need to be easier to implement in Silverlight solutions.&#160; <ul>       <li>I’d go so far as to say that <a href="http://mvvmlight.codeplex.com/">MVVM Light</a> should ship with Visual Studio. With the project / item templates and code snippets Laurent puts you into the right direction. This is the way that it should have been. Easy for the 9-5 developer to grasp. I believe the majority of developers use code behind because that’s what is in all the demos provided by Microsoft. They are not trying to write sucky code it is that t<u>hey simply don’t know a better way.</u>&#160; </li>     </ul>   </li>    <li>The XAP Files should be obfuscated/unused references deleted by default when in “Release” mode.      <ul>       <li>A better Silverlight experience starts with a smaller XAP file. The less that a user has to download is the better even with the majority of people on broadband. I would also recommend built-in obfuscation by Microsoft. People are paranoid that they can rename the .zip and run it through reflector. </li>     </ul>   </li>    <li>Get rid of the boring install experiences.      <ul>       <li><a href="http://www.riagenic.com/archives/299">Here</a> is a great write up on what I’m talking about. The default “Install Silverlight” and “Loading screens” suck. They suck bad. We need a choice of templates that a professional designer has created.&#160; </li>     </ul>   </li>    <li>Silverlight needs to supports more image formats.      <ul>       <li>For example: it would be great to use .gif’s without converting them to .png.&#160;&#160;&#160; </li>     </ul>   </li>    <li>Switching between Blend 4 and VS2010 to develop a Silverlight application is a pain.      <ul>       <li>Probably one of the biggest issues that I can’t think of a good solution for. It would be nice if VS2012 had the best of both worlds and you never have to leave VS. </li>     </ul>   </li>    <li>We need reporting controls with SSRS included with the Silverlight Toolkit.      <ul>       <li>I can’t think of another control that we need built into the toolkit. It would also be helpful to have export to .xls .pdf and .doc included with the control. </li>     </ul>   </li> </ol>  <p>I hope that this post will at least get a few people talking. Who knows Microsoft could be working on these things right now. Thanks for reading!</p>
