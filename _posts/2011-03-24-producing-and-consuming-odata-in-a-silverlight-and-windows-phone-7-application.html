(Part 4)&#160; – Consuming OData in a Windows Phone 7 Application (Mango).</a> </li> </ol>  <p>To refresh your memory on what OData is:</p>  <p>The <strong>Open Data Protocol (OData)</strong> is simply an open web protocol for querying and updating data. It allows for the consumer to query the datasource (usually over HTTP) and retrieve the results in Atom JSON or plain XML format including pagination ordering or filtering of the data.</p>  <p>To recap what we learned in the previous section on Silverlight 4:</p>  <ul>   <li>We began by creating the User Interface and setting up our bindings on our elements.&#160; </li>    <li>We added a service reference pointing to our OData Data Service inside our project.&#160; </li>    <li>Finally we added code behind to sort and filter the data coming from our OData Data Source into our Silverlight 4 Application. </li> </ul>  <p>In this <a href="http://www.silverlightshow.net/items/Producing-and-Consuming-OData-in-a-Silverlight-and-Windows-Phone-7-application-Part-3.aspx">article</a> I am going to show you how to consume an OData Data Source using Windows Phone 7. After you have read this series of articles you should be able to produce and consume an OData Data Source using the web browser LinqPad Silverlight 4 and Windows Phone 7. We have also learned how to do some basic sorting and filtering using all the same. Now that you are equipped with a solid understanding of producing and consuming OData Data Services you can begin to use this in your own applications.
