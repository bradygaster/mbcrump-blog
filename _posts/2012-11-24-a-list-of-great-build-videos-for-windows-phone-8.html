The list below is <em>specifically</em> for <strong>Windows Phone 8</strong> which I am very excited about as well as Windows 8. All of these sessions are hand picked so you may want to look at the <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/events/build/2012#tab_sortBy_day">complete list</a> of all the sessions. Iâ€™d also like to point out that //build/ had other sessions besides Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8 so go take a look now.</p>  <h3>The Session List</h3>  <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2" width="800" border="1"><tbody>     <tr>       <td valign="top" width="400">Session</td>        <td valign="top" width="398">Abstract</td>     </tr>      <tr>       <td valign="top" width="400">         <p><a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2012/2-013">Windows Phone 8: Application Model</a></p>       </td>        <td valign="top" width="398">Windows Phone 8 dramatically expands the ways in which developers can build applications and games by adding several new programming models and also expanding the application model to support a broader set of developer scenarios. Andrew will explore these in depth and give you the information you need to get started building applications that leverage these features today.</td>     </tr>      <tr>       <td valign="top" width="400">         <p><a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2012/3-046">Windows Phone 8: Native C/C++ Game Development</a></p>       </td>        <td valign="top" width="398">You asked for it and we are in the business of empowering our developers!
