If you are interested in joining Microsoft's Research Program, then it only requires two steps: 


 1. Copy and paste my name "Michael Crump" and enter it in the "how did you hear about us" field (located in step 2).
 2. The site is located [here](https://t.e2ma.net/click/m5cyf/q0j7kh/q4m4bb).

I'm part of this program and I've seen the impact it makes on future products. Microsoft will also give you either **cash** or other prizes like an **Xbox One** if you help them.  So give it a shot and let me know if you have any questions.
