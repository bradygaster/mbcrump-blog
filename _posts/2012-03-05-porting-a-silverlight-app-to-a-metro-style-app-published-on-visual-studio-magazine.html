<p>I have a new article published on Visual Studio Magazine today called “<a href="http://visualstudiomagazine.com/articles/2012/03/01/from-silverlight-to-metro.aspx">Porting a Silverlight App to a Metro-Style App</a>”. This article take Scott Gu’s famous Silverlight 2 Digg Applications and ports it to Windows 8 Metro-Style. I had a lot of fun writing this article and hope that you enjoy reading it. </p>  <h3>Article Introduction</h3>  <p>Windows 8 which was introduced at the Microsoft BUILD conference last year is an exciting new OS that introduced a new UI as well as a new runtime: Windows Runtime called WinRT. It's the backbone of the new Metro experience in Windows 8. Like many others I've been playing with Windows 8 and kept hearing that Silverlight skills can be reused in Metro-style applications. I decided to find out for myself by taking a Silverlight 2 project and seeing how easy it was to port to a Windows 8 Metro application using C#/XAML.</p>    <h3>The Full Article</h3>  <p>The full article is hosted on Visual Studio Magazine and you can access it by clicking <a href="http://visualstudiomagazine.com/articles/2012/03/01/from-silverlight-to-metro.aspx">here</a>.
